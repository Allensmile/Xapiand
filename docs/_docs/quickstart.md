title: Quick-start

This guide will take you through the process of installing Xapiand and
familiarize you with the concepts that will allow you to use search and
storage indexes. **DON'T PANIC**, it will take just a few minutes.

## Installing and Running


### Using Homebrew under macOS

{:class="plat_osx"}
```sh
# Install with Homebrew:
~ $ brew install Kronuz/tap/xapiand

# Run in foreground with *very-very-very* verbose output:
~ $ xapiand -vvvv
```

### Using Docker

```sh
# Run from Docker with *very-very-very* verbose output:
docker run -p 8880:8880 --rm dubalu/xapiand:{{ site.version }} -vvvv
```

{: .note .tip }
**_High Verbosity_**<br>
For testing, we recommend running with _*very-very-very* verbose_ output, which
can be specified by using `-vvvv` or `--verbosity=4`. This will log all full
requests and will also turn on `pretty`, `echo` and `comments` options. See
[Options](/docs/options) for more details.

You can also check the [Installation]({{ '/docs/installation' | relative_url }})
section for more details.

## Indexing

Let's try and index some twitter like information. First, let's create a
twitter user, and add some tweets (the twitter index will be created
automatically):

{% capture req %}

```json
PUT /twitter/user/Kronuz

{
  "name" : "German M. Bravo"
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}


{% capture req %}

```json
PUT /twitter/tweet/1

{
  "user": "Kronuz",
  "postDate": "2016-11-15T13:12:00",
  "message": "Trying out Xapiand, so far, so good... so what!"
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}


{% capture req %}

```json
PUT /twitter/tweet/2

{
  "user": "Kronuz",
  "postDate": "2016-10-15T10:31:18",
  "message": "Another tweet, will it be indexed?"
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

You can dig a little deeper in the [Data Manipulation]({{ '/docs/manipulation' | relative_url }}) section.

## Searching

Now, let's see if the information that was added by GETting it:

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /twitter/user/Kronuz
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /twitter/tweet/1
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /twitter/tweet/2
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

Let's find all the tweets that Kronuz posted:

{% capture req %}

```json
SEARCH /twitter/tweet/?q=user:Kronuz
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

You can find out more in the [Data Exploration]({{ '/docs/exploration' | relative_url }})
section.
