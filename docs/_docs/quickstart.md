title: Quick-start
---

This guide will take you through the process of installing Xapiand and
familiarize you with the concepts that will allow you to use search and
storage indexes. **DON'T PANIC**, it will take just a few minutes.

---

## Installing and Running

```sh
# Install with Homebrew:
~ $ brew tap Kronuz/tap
~ $ brew install xapiand

# Run in foreground with very verbose output:
~ $ mkdir my-database
~ $ cd my-database
~/my-database $ xapiand -vvvv
```

You can also check the [Installation]({{ '/docs/installation/' | relative_url }})
section for more details.

## Indexing

Let's try and index some twitter like information. First, let's create a
twitter user, and add some tweets (the twitter index will be created
automatically):

{% capture json %}

```json
PUT /twitter/user/Kronuz?pretty
{
  "name" : "German M. Bravo"
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html json=json %}


{% capture json %}

```json
PUT /twitter/tweet/1?pretty
{
  "user": "Kronuz",
  "postDate": "2016-11-15T13:12:00",
  "message": "Trying out Xapiand, so far, so good... so what!"
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html json=json %}


{% capture json %}

```json
PUT /twitter/tweet/2?pretty
{
  "user": "Kronuz",
  "postDate": "2016-10-15T10:31:18",
  "message": "Another tweet, will it be indexed?"
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html json=json %}

You can dig a little deeper in the [Modifying Your Data]({{ '/docs/modifying/' | relative_url }}) section.

## Searching

Now, let's see if the information that was added by GETting it:

{% capture json %}

```json
GET /twitter/user/Kronuz?pretty
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html json=json %}

{% capture json %}

```json
GET /twitter/tweet/1?pretty
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html json=json %}

{% capture json %}

```json
GET /twitter/tweet/2?pretty
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html json=json %}

Let's find all the tweets that Kronuz posted:

{% capture json %}

```json
GET /twitter/tweet/:search?q=user:Kronuz&pretty
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html json=json %}

## Where to go from here?

Xapiand is both a simple and complex product. We've so far learned the basics
of what it is, how to look inside of it, and how to work with it using some of
the REST APIs. Hopefully this guide has given you a better understanding of
what Xapiand is and more importantly, inspired you to further experiment with
the rest of its great features!
