title: Clustering

Xapiand is built to be always available and to scale with your needs. Scale can
come from buying **bigger servers** (_vertical scale_, or _scaling up_) or from
buying **more servers** (_horizontal scale_, or _scaling out_).

While Xapiand can benefit from more-powerful hardware, vertical scale has its
limits. Real scalability comes from horizontal scale: the ability to add more
nodes to the cluster and to spread load and reliability between them.

With most databases, scaling horizontally usually requires a major overhaul of
your application to take advantage of these extra boxes. In contrast, Xapiand
is distributed by nature: it knows how to manage multiple nodes to provide
scale and high availability. This also means that your application doesn't
need to care about it.


## What is a Cluster?

A node is a running instance of Xapiand, while a cluster consists of one or
more nodes running under the same _cluster name_ that are working together to
share their data and workload.

One node in the cluster is elected to be the master node, which is in charge of
managing cluster-wide changes like creating or deleting an index, or adding or
removing a node from the cluster. The master node does not need to be involved
in document-level changes or searches, which means that having just one master
node will not become a bottleneck as traffic grows. Any node can become the
master.

As users, we can talk to any node in the cluster, including the master node.
Every node knows where each document lives and can forward our request directly
to the nodes that hold the data we are interested in. Whichever node we talk to
manages the process of gathering the response from the node or nodes holding
the data and returning the final response to the client. It is all managed
transparently by Xapiand.


## An Empty Cluster

If we start a single node, with no data and no indices, our cluster,
**a cluster with one empty node**, looks like this:

![A cluster with one empty node]({{ '/assets/cluster1.png' | absolute_url }})

Our example cluster has only one node, so it performs the master role.


## Add an Index

To add data to Xapiand, we need an _index_, a place to store related data.
In reality, an index is just a logical namespace that points to one or more
physical shards.

A _shard_ is a low-level _worker unit_ that holds just a slice of all the data
in the index. Our documents are stored and indexed in shards, but our
applications don't talk to them directly. Instead, they talk to an index.

Shards are how Xapiand distributes data around your cluster. Think of shards as
containers for data. Documents are stored in shards, and shards are allocated to
nodes in your cluster. As your cluster grows or shrinks, Xapiand will
automatically migrate shards between nodes so that the cluster remains balanced.

A shard can be either a _primary shard_ or a _replica shard_. Each document in
your index belongs to a single primary shard, so the number of primary shards
that you have determines the maximum amount of data that your index can hold.

A replica shard is just a copy of a primary shard. Replicas are used to provide
redundant copies of your data to protect against hardware failure, and to serve
read requests like searching or retrieving a document.

The number of primary shards in an index is fixed at the time that an index is
created, but the number of replica shards can be changed at any time.

Let's create an index called blogs in our empty one-node cluster. By default,
indices are assigned five primary shards, but for the purpose of this
demonstration, we'll assign just three primary shards and one replica (one
replica of every primary shard):

{% capture req %}

```sh
PUT /blogs/

{
   "_settings" : {
      "number_of_shards" : 3,
      "number_of_replicas" : 1
   }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

Our cluster now looks like **a single-node cluster with an index**. All three
primary shards have been allocated to `Node 1`:

![A single-node cluster with an index]({{ '/assets/cluster2.png' | absolute_url }})

Currently, our cluster is fully functional but at risk of data loss in case of
hardware failure.


## Add Failover

Running a single node means that you have a single point of failure) there is
no
redundancy. Fortunately, all we need to do to protect ourselves from data loss
is to start another node.

If we start a second node, our cluster would look like
**a two-node cluster with all primary and replica shards allocated**:

![A two-node cluster with all primary and replica shards allocated]({{ '/assets/cluster3.png' | absolute_url }})

The second node has joined the cluster, and three _replica shards_ have been
allocated to it, one for each primary shard. That means that we can lose either
node, and all of our data will be intact.

Any newly indexed document will first be stored on a primary shard, and then
copied to the associated replica shard(s). This ensures that our document can
be retrieved from a primary shard or from any of its replicas.


# Scaling Out

**_Unimplemented Nodes Reallocation!_**<br>
Node reallocation during _scaling out_ is not yet implemented.
<br>[Pull requests are welcome!]({{ site.repository }}/pulls){:target="_blank"}

If we start a third node, our cluster reorganizes itself to look like
**a three-node cluster with shards reallocated to spread the load**:

![A three-node cluster with shards reallocated to spread the load]({{ '/assets/cluster4.png' | absolute_url }})

One shard each from `Node 1` and `Node 2` have moved to the new `Node 3`, and we have
two shards per node, instead of three. This means that the hardware resources
(CPU, RAM, I/O) of each node are being shared among fewer shards, allowing
each shard to perform better.

The number of primary shards is _fixed_ at the moment an index is created.
Effectively, that number defines the maximum amount of data that can be stored
in the index (the actual number depends on your data, your hardware and your
use case); however, read requests (searches or document retrieval) can be
handled by a primary or a replica shard, so the more copies of data that you
have, the more search throughput you can handle.

The number of replica shards can be changed dynamically on a live cluster,
allowing us to scale up or down as demand requires. Let's increase the number
of replicas from the default of `1` to `2`:

{% capture req %}

```sh
PUT /blogs/

{
   "_settings" : {
      "number_of_replicas" : 2
   }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

After **increasing the number of replicas to 2**, the blogs index now has nine
shards (three primaries and six replicas). This means that we can scale out to
a total of nine nodes, again with one shard per node. This would allow us to
triple search performance compared to our original three-node cluster:

![Increasing the number of replicas to 2]({{ '/assets/cluster5.png' | absolute_url }})

{: .note .info }
**_You need to add hardware to increase throughput_**<br>
Just having more replica shards on the same number of nodes doesn't
increase our performance at all because each shard has access to a smaller
fraction of its node's resources.


## Coping with Failure

We've said that Xapiand can cope when nodes fail, so let's go ahead and try it
out. Let's look at our **cluster after killing node one**:

![Cluster after killing node one]({{ '/assets/cluster6.png' | absolute_url }})

The node we killed was the master node. A cluster must have a master node in
order to function correctly, so the first thing that happened was that the
nodes elected a new master: `Node 2`.

Primary shards `P1` and `P2` were lost when we killed `Node 1`, and our index
cannot function properly if it is missing primary shards.

Fortunately, a complete copy of the two lost primary shards exists on other
nodes, so the first thing that the new master node did was to promote the
replicas of these shards on `Node 2` and `Node 3` to be primaries. This
promotion process is instantaneous, like the flick of a switch.

If we restart `Node 1`, The **cluster after restarting node one** would be able
to allocate the missing replica shards:

![Cluster after restarting node one]({{ '/assets/cluster7.png' | absolute_url }})

If `Node 1` still had copies of the old shards, it would try to reuse them,
copying over from the primary shard only the missing parts that have changed in
the meantime.
