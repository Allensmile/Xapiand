title: Queries
---

Queries within Xapiand are the mechanism by which documents are searched for
within a database. They can be a simple search for text-based terms or a search
based on the values assigned to documents, which can be combined using a number
of different methods to produce more complex queries.


## Simple Queries

The most basic query is a search for a single textual term. This will find all
documents in the database which have that term assigned to them. These kind of
queries are called "**leaf queries**".

#### Example

For example, a search might be for the term "_banana_" assigned in the
"_favoriteFruit_" field and restricting the size of results to one result by
using the keyword `_limit`, which by default is set to 10:

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": {
    "favoriteFruit": "banana"
  },
  "_limit": 1
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

When a query is executed, the result is a list of documents that match the
query, together with a **weight**, a **rank** and a **percent** for each which
indicates how good a match for the query that particular document is.


## Logical Operators

Each query produces a list of documents with a weight according to how good a
match each document is for that query. These queries can then be combined to
produce a more complex tree-like query structure, with the operators acting as
branches within the tree.

The most basic operators are the logical operators: `_or`, `_and` and `_not` -
these match documents in the following way:

* `_or`           - Finds documents which match any of the subqueries.
* `_and`          - Finds documents which match all of the subqueries.
* `_not`          - Finds documents which don't match any of the subqueries.
* `_and_not`      - Finds documents which match the first subquery A but
                    not subquery B.
* `_xor`          - Finds documents which are matched by subquery A or other or
                    subquery B, but not both.

Each operator produces a weight for each document it matches, which depends on
the weight of one or both subqueries in the following way:

* `_or`           - Matches documents with the sum of all weights of the subqueries.
* `_and`          - Matches documents with the sum of all weights of the subqueries.
* `_not`          - Finds documents which don't match any of the subqueries.
* `_and_not`      - Matches documents with the weight from subquery A only.

#### Example

For example, the following matches all of those who either like _bananas_ or
are _brown-eyed females_:

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": {
    "_or": [
      {
        "favoriteFruit": "banana"
      },
      {
        "_and": [
            { "gender": "female" },
            { "eyeColor": "brown" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}


## Maybe

In addition to the basic logical operators, there is an additional logical
operator `_and_maybe` which matches any document which matches A (whether or
not B matches). If only B matches, then `_and_maybe` doesn't match. For this
operator, the weight is the sum of the matching subqueries, so:

* `_and_maybe`    - Finds any document which matches the first element of the
                    array and whether or not matches the rest.

1. Documents which match A and B match with the weight of A+B
2. Documents which match A only match with weight of A

This allows you to state that you require some terms (A) and that other
terms (B) are useful but not required.

#### Example

For example, the following matches all of those who like _bananas_ and which
maybe are also are _brown-eyed females_. It will return _brown-eyed females_
who like _bananas_ first:

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": {
    "_and_maybe": [
      {
        "favoriteFruit": "banana"
      },
      {
        "_and": [
            { "gender": "female" },
            { "eyeColor": "brown" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}


## Filtering

A query can be filtered by another query. There are two ways to apply a filter
to a query depending whether you want to include or exclude documents:

* `_filter`       - Matches documents which match both subqueries, but the
                    weight is only taken from the left subquery (in other
                    respects it acts like `_and`.
* `_and_not`      - Matches documents which match the left subquery but donâ€™t
                    match the right hand one (with weights coming from the left
                    subquery)

#### Example

For example, the following matches all who like _bananas_ filtering the results
to those who also are _brown-eyed females_, but this filter doesn't affect
weights:

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": {
    "_filter": [
      {
        "favoriteFruit": "banana"
      },
      {
        "_and": [
            { "gender": "female" },
            { "eyeColor": "brown" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}


## Elite Set

Picks the best _N_ subqueries and combine them with `_or`.

If you want to find documents similar to a piece of text, an obvious approach
is to build an `_or` query from all the terms in the text, and run this query
against a database containing the documents. However such a query can contain
lots of terms and be quite slow to perform, yet many of these terms don't
contribute usefully to the results.

The `_elite_set` operator can be used instead of `_or` in this situation.
`_elite_set` selects the **most important** _N_ terms and then acts as an `_or`
query with just these, ignoring any other terms. This will usually return
results just as good as the full `_or` query, but much faster.

In general, the `_elite_set` operator can be used when you have a large OR
query, but it doesn't matter if the search completely ignores some of the less
important terms in the query.

The subqueries don't have to be terms, but if they aren't then `_elite_set`
will look at the estimated frequencies of the subqueries and so could pick a
subset which don't actually match any documents even if the full OR would
match some.

You can specify a parameter to the query constructor which control the number
of terms which `_elite_set` will pick. If not specified, this defaults to _10_.

If the number of subqueries is less than this threshold, `_elite_set`
behaves identically to `_or`.

For example, this will pick the best 7 terms:


## Additional Operators

* `_max`          - Pick the maximum weight of any subquery. This matches the
                    same documents as a `_or`, but the weight contributed is
                    the maximum weight from any matching subquery (for `_or`,
                    it's the sum of the weights from the matching subqueries).


<!--
* `_wildcard`     - Wildcard expansion.
* `_scale_weight` -
* `_synonym`      -
 -->

## Range Searches

The keyword `_range` matches documents where the given value is between the
given `_from` and `_to` fixed range (including both endpoints).

If you only use the keyword `_from` matches documents where the given value is
greater than or equal to a fixed value.

If you only use the keyword `_to` matches documents where the given value is
less than or equal a fixed value.

#### Example

This example find _all_ bank accounts for which their account holders are
_females_ in the ages between 20 and 30:

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": {
    "_and": [
      { "gender": "female" },
      {
        "age": {
          "_in": {
            "_range": {
              "_from": 20,
              "_to": 30
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}


## Near

Another commonly used operator is `NEAR`, which finds terms within 10 words
of each other in the current document, behaving like `_and` with regard to
weights, so that:

* Documents which match A within 10 words of B are matched, with weight of A+B

#### Example

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": {
    "personality": "adventurous NEAR ambitious"
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}


{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": {
    "personality": {
      "_near": "adventurous ambitious"
    }
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}


## Phrase

A phrase is surrounded with double quotes (`""`) and allows searching for a
specific exact phrase and returns only matches where all terms appear in the
document in the correct order, giving a weight of the sum of each term.
For example:

* Documents which match A followed by B followed by C gives a weight of A+B+C

{: .note .info}
**_Note_**<br>
When searching for phrases, _stop words_ do not apply.

{: .note .warning}
**_Caution_**<br>
Hyphenated words are also treated as phrases, as are cases such as filenames
and email addresses (e.g. `/etc/passwd` or `president@whitehouse.gov`)

#### Example

In the following example, we will retrieve documents with the exact phrase,
including the stop words `these`, `are`, `few`, `and` `far` and `between`.

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": {
    "personality": "\"these days are few and far between\""
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": {
    "personality": {
      "_phrase": "these days are few and far between"
    }
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}


## Love and Hate

The `+` and `-` operators, select documents based on the presence or absence of
specified terms.

{: .note .info}
**_Note_**<br>
When using these operators, _stop words_ do not apply.


#### Example

The following matches all documents with the phrase _"adventurous nature"_ but
not _ambitious_; and:

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": {
    "personality": "\"adventurous nature\" -ambitious"
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}


{: .note .warning}
**_Caution_**<br>
One thing to note is that the behaviour of the +/- operators vary depending on
the default operator used and the above examples assume that the default (`OR`)
is used.
