The **_Hierarchical Triangular Mesh_** is a multi-level, recursive decomposition
of the sphere. It starts with an octahedron and we call "_level 0 **trixels**"_ to
each of its eight equilateral triangle faces. Each _trixel_ can then be split
into four smaller _trixels_ by introducing new vertices at the midpoints of each
side. _Trixel_ division repeats recursively and indefinitely to produce smaller
and smaller _trixels_:

Although the division process can continue indefinitely, the internal 64-bit
representation runs out of bits at level 31 (i.e. `8 * 4^31` > `2^64`).

Approximate distance (in meters) for each level is calculated using the formula:
`(6371008.8 * 2 * PI / 4) / (2^level)`, and distance in arcseconds is calculated
using the formula: `(360 * 60 * 60 / 4) / (2^level)`. For example, level 25 is
about 10 milli-arcseconds for astronomers or 0.3 meters on the earth's surface:
