title: Min Aggregation
---

A _single-value_ metrics aggregation that keeps track and returns the minimum
value among numeric values extracted from the aggregated documents. These
values are extracted from specific numeric fields in the documents.

{: .note .info}
**_Limits_**<br>
The `_min` aggregation operates on the `double` representation of the data.
As a consequence, the result may be approximate when running on longs whose
absolute value is greater than 2^53.

Computing the min balance value across all accounts:

{% capture req %}

```json
POST /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": "*",
  "_limit": 0,
  "_check_at_least": 1000,
  "_aggs": {
    "max_balance": {
      "_min": {
        "_field": "balance"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

Response:

```json
{
    "#aggregations": {
        "_doc_count": 1000,
        "max_balance": {
            "_min": 1002.25
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

As can be seen, the name of the aggregation (`min_price` above) also serves as
the key by which the aggregation result can be retrieved from the returned
response.


## Missing value

The `_missing` parameter defines how documents that are missing a value should
be treated. By default they will be ignored but it is also possible to treat
them as if they had a value.

{% capture req %}

```json
POST /bank/:search?pretty

{
  "_query": "*",
  "_limit": 0,
  "_check_at_least": 1000,
  "_aggs": {
    "min_balance": {
      "_min": {
        "_field": "balance",
        "_missing": 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

Documents without a value in the `balance` field will fall into the same bucket
as documents that have the value `0`.
