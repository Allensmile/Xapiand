title: Create Index API
short_title: Create API
---

The _Create Index API_ is used to manually create or update an index in Xapiand.

All documents in Xapiand are stored inside of one index or another, indexes
are usually dynamically created, but certain settings can only be set for
new indexes.

This creates an index named `twitter/tweet` with all default setting:

{% capture req %}

```json
PUT /twitter/tweet/
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

{: .note .warning }
`PUT /twitter/tweet/` is not the same as `PUT /twitter/tweet`, the former creates index
`/twitter/tweet/` and the later adds document `twitter/tweet` to index `/`.
[Trailing slashes are important]({{ '/docs/reference-guide/api#trailing-slashes-are-important' | relative_url }}).


### Index Name Limitations

There are several limitations to what you can name your index. The complete
list of limitations is:

- Cannot be `.` or `..`
- Cannot include `\`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, ` ` (space character), `,`, `#`, `:`
- Cannot include `/` (as part of the name, it's used for paths)
- Connot include `.` (except for the first character)
- Full path cannot be longer than 243 bytes (note it is bytes, so multi-byte
  characters will count towards that limit faster)

Indices can be paths (including `/` as part of the path).


## Settings

Each index created can have specific settings associated with it, such can be
defined in the body:

{% capture req %}

```json
PUT /twitter/tweet/

{
  "_settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 3,
    "number_of_replicas": 2
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

The default for `number_of_shards` is `5`, and the default for
`number_of_replicas` is `1` (ie one replica for each primary shard), the above
command creates an index with `3` shards and `2` replicas.

`number_of_shards` and `number_of_replicas` can be specified like this only
for new indexes and any attempt to change the values during an update will
result in a Bad Request error.


## Schemas

The _Create Index API_ also allows to provide a schema, also to be defined in
the body:

{% capture req %}

```json
PUT /twitter/tweet/

{
  "_schema": {
    "schema": {
      "name": {
        "_type": "text"
      },
      "age": {
        "_type": "positive"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

More information about Schemas can be found [here]({{ '/docs/reference-guide/schemas' | relative_url }}).


{: .note .info }
**_Only for New Indices_**<br>
Some configurations about schemas can be set only the first time a field is
created (`_type`, for example) and any attempt to change the values during an
update will result in a Bad Request error.
