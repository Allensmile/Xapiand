The _Open / Close Index APIs_ allow to close an index, and later on opening it.
A closed index has almost _no overhead_ on the cluster, and is blocked for
read/write operations. A closed index can be opened which will then go through
the normal recovery process.

The REST endpoint command are `CLOSE` and `OPEN`. For example:

{% capture req %}

```json
CLOSE /my_index/
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}

{% capture req %}

```json
OPEN /my_index/
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}
