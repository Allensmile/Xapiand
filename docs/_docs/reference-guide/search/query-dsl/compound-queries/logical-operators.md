title: Logical Operators
---

Each query produces a list of documents with a weight according to how good a
match each document is for that query. These queries can then be combined to
produce a more complex tree-like query structure, with the operators acting as
branches within the tree.

The most basic operators are the logical operators: `_or`, `_and` and `_not` -
these match documents in the following way:

* `_or`           - Finds documents which match any of the subqueries.
* `_and`          - Finds documents which match all of the subqueries.
* `_not`          - Finds documents which don't match any of the subqueries.
* `_and_not`      - Finds documents which match the first subquery A but
                    not subquery B.
* `_xor`          - Finds documents which are matched by subquery A or other or
                    subquery B, but not both.

Each operator produces a weight for each document it matches, which depends on
the weight of one or both subqueries in the following way:

* `_or`           - Matches documents with the sum of all weights of the subqueries.
* `_and`          - Matches documents with the sum of all weights of the subqueries.
* `_not`          - Finds documents which don't match any of the subqueries.
* `_and_not`      - Matches documents with the weight from subquery A only.

#### Example

For example, the following matches all of those who either like _bananas_ or
are _brown-eyed females_:

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search

{
  "_query": {
    "_or": [
      {
        "favoriteFruit": "banana"
      },
      {
        "_and": [
            { "gender": "female" },
            { "eyeColor": "brown" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}
