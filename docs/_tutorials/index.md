In contrast to [Docs]({{ '/docs/' | relative_url }}), Tutorials provide more detailed, narrative
instruction that cover a variety of Xapiand topics and scenarios. Tutorials
might contain the following:

* Step-by-step processes through particular scenarios or challenges
* Full walk-throughs using sample data, showing inputs and results from the sample data
* Detailed explanation about the pros and cons for different Xapiand strategies
* End-to-end instruction in developing a complete feature on a Xapiand site
* Instruction that combines various techniques from across the docs

In short, tutorials aren't the core reference information in docs. They walk
users through processes from beginning to end.
