Of course he's also methodical, efficient and contemplative, but in a way they're lesser traits and tained by behaviors of being extreme as well. His forthright nature though, this is what he's often admired for. On many occasions people will count on this and his charm when they're feeling down. All and all, Christopher has a share of darker sides to deal with too. His maliciousness and coldness can cause things to heat up on often personal levels.

But focus on his as this is what he's purposely avoided. Even careful encounters have been ruined because of this and his carelessness, but different strokes for different folks I guess. All and all, David is complex and grey like the rest of us. He's efficient and clear-headed when around good friends, that's at least some form of redemption.

To top it off he's also extreme, pompous and petty, but at the very least they're countered somewhat by being punctual as well. But focus on his as this is what he's most disliked. There's no sugar coating the effects caused because of this and his neglectful nature, which is far from desired, but so be it. All and all, Chad is complex and grey like the rest of us. He's incorruptible and athletic among true friends, it's not like we're dealing with pure evil here.

Of course he's also athletic, independent and hardworking, but in a way they're lesser traits and tained by behaviors of being amoral as well. His realism though, this is what he's kind of cherished for. Friends tend to count on this and his humbleness especially when they need comforting or support. All and all, Christopher has plenty of character faults too. His agonizing nature and barbaric nature aren't exactly fun to deal with, though more on a personal level than for others.

That's without even stating he's also troublesome, argumentative and impatient, but their worst is softened by behaviors of being observant as well. But focus on his as this is what he's almost feared. Even careful encounters have been ruined because of this and his irritable nature, as sad of a reality as this may be. Fair is fair though, Jesus does have some endearing sides. He's witty and resourceful if nothing else, it's not like we've encountered the devil. Unfortunately his shallowness can always be counted on to turn things back for the worse.",

Of course he's also romantic, surprising and individualistic, but far less strongly and often mixed with being monstrous as well. His charm though, this is what he's kind of cherished for. Friends usually count on this and his methodical nature whenever they need help. Nobody's perfect of course and Patrick has plenty of rainy days too. His possessive nature and blunt nature are far from ideal, much to the annoyance of others. Fortunately his discipline usually softens the worst of it.",

Let alone the fact he's also insulting, treacherous and argumentative, but their effects are at least lessened by impulses of being focused as well. But focus on his as this is what he's most disliked. Even careful encounters have been ruined because of this and his argumentativeness, which is too bad for all sides. All and all, Taylor is complex and grey like the rest of us. He's efficient and romantic if you look for it, it's not like we're dealing with pure evil here. Unfortunately his crude ways is almost ever present and ready to sour the mood.",

As if that's not enough he's also obsessive, unstable and extreme, but their worst is softened by behaviors of being sentimental as well. But focus on his as this is what he's purposely avoided. Multiple enemies have been made because of this and his deviousness, but different strokes for different folks I guess. All and all, William does have some rays of light. He's cooperative and brilliant at the very least, that's at least some form of redemption. Unfortunately his desperation often pops up fast enough to ruin the chances of something good.",

Of course he's also sharing, courteous and discreet, but they're far less prominent, especially compared to impulses of being provocative as well. His adaptability though, this is what he's pretty much known for. There are many times when friends count on this and his outspoken nature whenever they need assistance or help. Nobody's perfect of course and Michael has plenty of less favorable characteristics too. His deceitful ways and barbaric nature do cause plenty of friction and could ruin plenty of evenings. Fortunately his adventurous nature assures this isn't the case very often.",

Even careful encounters have been ruined because of this and his hatred, which is a true shame for both sides. Fair is fair though, Eric does have some lighter sides. He's disciplined and sharing even if in small doses, it could be worth to take a chance just once. Unfortunately his venomous nature will forever be something to deal with.",
