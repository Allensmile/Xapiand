Of course she's also generous, decisive and determined, but they're in shorter supply, especially considering they're mixed with being possessive as well. Her perceptive nature though, this is what she's most popular for. Oftentimes people will count on this and her captivating nature when they're feeling down. All in all, Kelly has a fair share of lesser days too. Her irresponsibility and possessive nature cause plenty of grievances and make things uncomfortable to say the least. Fortunately her honor is there to relift spirits when needed.",

Of course he's also flexible, dynamic and charming, but they're in shorter supply, especially considering they're mixed with being possessive as well. His idealism though, this is what he's so well-liked for. Friends tend to count on this and his playfulness when they're feeling down. Nobody's perfect of course and Marcus has rotten moods and days too. His abrasiveness and argumentativeness can cause things to heat up and make things uncomfortable to say the least.

Of course he's also determined, confident and tolerant, but they're less prominent and often intertwined with being greedy as well. His insight though, this is what he's so well-liked for. On many occasions people will count on this and his aspirations whenever they need help. All in all, James has plenty of less favorable characteristics too. His uncaring nature and extreme nature do cause plenty of friction, both personally and for others. Fortunately his adventurous nature shines brighter on most days.",
