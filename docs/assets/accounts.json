His athleticism though, this is what he's so well-liked for. People regularly count on this and his grace whenever they need help. Nobody's perfect of course and James has plenty of lesser desired aspects too. His apathetic nature and instability can cause things to heat up and just affect all around negatively.

But focus on his as this is what he's often despised. Plenty of days have been ruined because of this and his childish nature, which is far from desired, but so be it. Fair is fair though, Marshall doesn't turn everything to dust. He's gracious and heroic even if in small doses, there's still a beacon of hope.

To make matters worse he's also insulting, dominating and insensitive, but in an odd way they're balanced by habits of being compassionate as well. But focus on his as this is what he's purposely avoided. Even the best intentions have been soured because of this and his superficial nature, which is too bad for all sides. Fair is fair though, Robert does have some endearing sides. He's surprising and wise even if in small doses, that's at least some form of redemption. Unfortunately his inconsideration is always there and ready to strike at the worst moments.",
