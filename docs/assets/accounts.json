His sociable nature though, this is what he's kind of cherished for. People regularly count on this and his cheerfulness whenever they need help. All and all, Brandon has plenty of less favorable traits too. His perversions and prejudices cause plenty of grievances and make things uncomfortable to say the least.

Her sense of order though, this is what she's pretty much loved for. On many occasions people will count on this and her reflective thinking when they're feeling down. All and all, Erika has plenty of character faults too. Her dishonesty and envy aren't exactly fun to deal with and beyond what people are willing to deal with.

But focus on her as this is what she's most condemned. There's a great deal of pain left on all sides because of this and her irresponsibility, as sad of a reality as this may be. Fair is fair though, Krystal does have some lighter sides. She's lovable and creative if nothing else, there's still a beacon of hope.

To make matters worse she's also monstrous, devious and hostile, but in an odd way they're balanced by habits of being warm as well. But focus on her as this is what she's pretty much \u00ba. Even the best intentions have been soured because of this and her crassness, but there's not much you can really do about it. Fair is fair though, Heather does have some lighter sides. She's compassionate and selfless for a start, that's at least some form of redemption. Unfortunately her dishonesty will forever be something to deal with.",

That's without even stating he's also coarse, dishonest and selfish, but at least they only show in smaller doses and mixed with behaviors of being creative as well. But focus on his as this is what he's pretty much \u00ba. Plenty of relationships came to a halt because of this and his provocative nature, which is far from desired, but so be it. All and all, Juan doesn't turn everything to dust. He's methodical and energetic among others, it isn't all doom and gloom. Unfortunately his instability will probably never truly go away.",

To make matters worse he's also apathetic, hateful and disruptive, but fortunately they're balanced out slightly by being gentle as well. But focus on his as this is what he's most condemned. Multiple nights have ended in disaster because of this and his opportunistic ways, but there's not much you can really do about it. Fair is fair though, Justin doesn't turn everything to dust. He's imaginative and sentimental if nothing else, there is still some hope yet. Unfortunately his narcissistic nature often spoils the fun that may have come from those traits.",

On many occasions people will count on this and her warmness whenever they need assistance or help. Nobody's perfect of course and Teresa has a range of flaws to deal with too.
