There's no sugar coating the effects caused because of this and her intolerance, but that may just be the nature of the beast. Fair is fair though, Christine does gave some redeeming qualities. She's independent and optimistic among true friends, it's not like we're dealing with pure evil here. Unfortunately her destructive nature will probably never truly go away."}

But focus on his as this is what he's purposely avoided. Even the best intentions have been soured because of this and his superficial nature, which is too bad for all sides. Fair is fair though, Robert does have some endearing sides. He's surprising and wise even if in small doses, that's at least some form of redemption. Unfortunately his inconsideration is always there and ready to strike at the worst moments."}

His warmness though, this is what he's most popular for. Friends usually count on this and his good nature whenever they need cheering up. Nobody's perfect of course and Phillip has rotten moods and days too. His intolerance and power-hungry ways aren't exactly fun to deal with and reach all around.
