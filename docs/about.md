Xapiand is a Modern Highly Available Distributed RESTful Search and Storage Engine
built for the cloud and with Data Locality. It features:

##### Liberal Open Source license:
  * MIT license *(Note Xapian engine itself is GNU GPL)*.
  * You can find the source code for Xapiand at [GitHub]:

##### HTTP RESTful API:
  * Document oriented.
  * No need for upfront schema definition.

##### Search Engine:
  * Built on top of [Xapian]{:target="_blank"} indexes.

##### Storage Engine:
  * Each index also offers storage of files: à la Facebook's Haystack <sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup>.

##### Support for query Aggregations.

##### Multi Tenant with Multi Types:
  * Support for more than one index.
  * Support for different types, one per index.
  * Index level configuration:
    * Schema.

##### Efficient and Scalable architecture:
  * (Near) Real Time Search.
  * Event driven asynchronous architecture using [libev](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html){:target="_blank"}.
  * Written in modern C++.

##### Geo-spatial support:
  * Uses the Hierarchical Triangular Mesh <sup>[2](#footnote-2)</sup> for indexing.
  * Accepts multiple Coordinate Reference Systems, including WGS84.
  * Implements EWKT.

##### High Availability:
  * Automatic node operation rerouting.
  * Replicas exists to maximize high availability *and* data locality.
  * Read and Search operations performed on any of the replicas.
  * Reliable, asynchronous replication for long term persistence.

##### Multi-Partitioning and Distribution Strategies:
  * Random Consistent Partitioning and Replication.
