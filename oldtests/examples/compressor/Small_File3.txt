Translator’s Introduction
Hegel’s Lectures on the Philosophy of History are recognized
in Germany as a popular introduction to his system; their form is
less rigid than the generality of metaphysical treatises, and the
illustrations, which occupy a large proportion of the work, are
drawn from a field of observation more familiar perhaps, than
any other, to those who have not devoted much time to
metaphysical studies. One great value of the work is that it
presents the leading facts of history from an altogether novel
point of view. And when it is considered that the writings of
Hegel have exercised a marked influence on the political
movements of Germany, it will be admitted that his theory of the
universe, especially that part which bears directly upon politics,
deserves attention even from those who are the most exclusive
advocates of the “practical.”
A writer who has established his claim to be regarded as an
authority, by the life which he has infused into metaphysical
abstractions, has pronounced the work before us, “one of the
pleasantest books on the subject he ever read.”1
And compared with that of most German writers, even the
style may claim to be called vigorous and pointed. If therefore in
its English dress the “Philosophy of History“ should be found
deficient in this respect, the fault must not be attributed to the
original.
